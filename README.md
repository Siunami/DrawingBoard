# DrawingBoard 

Realtime drawing board app from UBCHacks 2017 Workshops.

Credits to Matthew Siu.

I wanted to learn more about socket.io, so I made some additional changes:
* Add 'Clear' button to clear the canvas for all users
* Show number of users currently online
* Allow users to choose and change their colors

Future changes:
* Nicknames

Deployed onto heroku here: https://draw-your-thang.herokuapp.com/
