# DrawingBoard 

Simple web app from UBCHacks 2017 Workshops.
Credit goes to Matthew Siu.

I wanted to learn more about socket.io, so I made some additional changes:
* Add 'Clear' button to clear the canvas for all users
* Show number of users currently online

Future changes:
* Nicknames
* Choose colour
